### Key Health Components
- `cards/basic/` - Basic patient information forms

- `charts/` - Interactive health metric visualizations
- `measures/` - SCORE2, BMI, diabetes calculation engines
- `localization/` - Multi-language support (English/Dutch)

## NPM script

To run any of those scripts:

```bash
npm run <script>
```

- `start`: Start the app in development mode
- `package`: Package your application into a platform-specific executable bundle and put the result in a folder.
- `make`: Generate platform-specific distributables (e.g. .exe, .dmg, etc) of your application for distribution.
- `publish`: Electron Forge's way of taking the artifacts generated by the `make` command and sending them to a service somewhere for you to distribute or use as updates.
- `lint`: Run ESLint to lint the code
- `format`: Run Prettier to check the code (it doesn't change the code)
- `format:write`: Run Prettier to format the code
- `test`: Run the default unit-test script (Vitest)
- `test:watch`: Run the default unit-test script in watch mode (Vitest)
- `test:unit`: Run the Vitest tests
- `test:e2e`: Run the Playwright tests
- `test:all`: Run all tests (Vitest and Playwright)

> The test scripts involving Playwright require the app be builded before running the tests. So, before run the tests, run the `package`, `make` or `publish` script.

## Development Setup 🚀

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phjdreef/thewellclinic.git
